# tic-tac-toe-game
This project is a command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game supports two players, allowing them to play alternately. The players input their moves via the keyboard, and the game checks for winning conditions after each move. The board is displayed after each turn to show the current game state.
